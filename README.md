Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemics led the Indian Automobile Industry on the backfoot nearly for about seven
months. The industry is not in its best position considering the high competition from international
players, buyers’ high bargaining power, and some threat from ride-hailing services. Considering the
industry’s value chain due to the new government norms, companies have to include mandatory safety
factors like air-bags & ABS, which increase the cost tremendously for lower segment vehicles. However,
the recent numbers in Quarter 4 tell a different story because of the increase of about 20% compared to
the previous year’s quarter. This can be attributed to the festive season and the government’s decision to
reduce the interest rate on the loans and provide ex-gratia payment benefit. Therefore, most vehicle
manufacturers ended 2020 on a positive note, registering good wholesales growth, and entering the new
year with ‘cautious optimism’ driven by expectations of a V-shaped economic recovery.

Companies in the automobile industry have also increased their budget for the R&D and have focused
more on the safety and feature up-gradation in mid & upper segment vehicles. Also, India’s automobile
sector has the highest spending in R&D than any other sector in India, which indicates a huge potential
for this industry’s future. With the rapid growth in this sector, market leaders like Tata Motors have
accelerated its drive for engineering excellence and innovation receiving 98 patents in 2020. These
patents predominantly relate to CESS’s megatrend (connected, electrified, sustainable and safe)
automobiles. This shows the industry’s willingness towards adopting Electric Vehicles shortly.

However, the EVs market is still in its early stages and is difficult to predict. Once the EVs hit the market,
the existing equation in the automobile industry might change. EV’s produce less sound and is efficient
& quick. The dilemma comes in the charging infrastructure and government tax policies. A large part of
the Indian government’s tax revenue comes from petrol and diesel. So, if the EVs start dominating the
market, the government might lay a tax on the EV & even on charging stations that are exempted in the
current tax regime. EVs are not entirely carbon-neutral, but they emit significantly fewer emissions
throughout their life-cycle than existing vehicles. Also, one can reasonably expect these emissions to
further reduce in the future. Several domestic players like M&M & Tata Motors have already launched
Electric variants of existing traditional automobiles in the market, including bus, car & 3-wheeler. With
the entry of the electric car company Tesla in India, it is a clear indicator that there will be significant
competition in the market, and only a few players will survive at the end. EVs are superior compared to
their traditional counterparts in almost all the parameters. The shift in the automobile industry trend
towards EVs can be observed, and hence, it’s not too late to predict that EVs in the coming years will
dominate the automobile industry.
